However, the environmental impact of 3D printing is a growing concern, as most 3D printing filaments fall under <strong>Category 7</strong> and are not widely recyclable.</p> <h3>How Much Plastic Waste Does 3D Printing Generate?</h3> <p>As of 2021, the UK had approximately <strong>168,000 installed 3D printers</strong>. On average, hobbyist users consume around <strong>12 kg of filament annually</strong>, with up to <strong>10% of this material becoming immediate waste</strong> due to failed prints.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Total 3D Printers in the UK (2021):</strong> 168,000</li> <li><strong>Average Annual Filament Usage per Printer:</strong> 12 kg</li> <li><strong>Total Annual Filament Usage:</strong> 2,016,000 kg</li> <li><strong>Estimated Waste Percentage:</strong> 10%</li> <li><strong>Total Annual Waste:</strong> 201,600 kg</li> </ul> <p>This means that hobbyist 3D printing in the UK alone contributes approximately <strong>201.6 tonnes of plastic waste</strong> to landfills each year. However, this is only the immediate wasteâ€”eventually, <strong>100% of the plastic used in 3D printing will end up in landfills</strong>, as even completed prints degrade over time and require disposal.</p> <p>While some companies are working on recycling solutions for used 3D printing plastic, these options remain limited. <strong>PLA</strong>, for example, is biodegradable in industrial composting conditions but does not break down naturally in landfill environments. <strong>ABS, PETG, and Nylon</strong> are even more difficult to recycle and require specialised facilities that are not widely available."
